The AI engineer's work on Hapployed progressed through several phases. Initially, it focused on UI enhancements for homepage, opportunities, and gigs, alongside core feature development like Voice-Only Mode (GPT-5, translation, smart suggestions) and a comprehensive 9-section enterprise-grade Settings module. The job posting flow was integrated with backend APIs, moving from mock to real data. Subsequently, the Epic Platform Innovations were initiated, including backend infrastructure for worker features and AI matching, and a frontend . After resolving backend data fetching and frontend rendering issues, the user provided a complete, unified platform redesign (HTML/CSS), consolidating Opportunities and Gigs Near Me into a hybrid feed, introducing a role-switching dashboard, and a smart posting flow. The AI engineer is now tasked with implementing this new unified vision, starting with specific homepage updates and integrating the provided HTML/CSS.

<product_requirements>
The Hapployed application aims for a modern, futuristic UI and unified user experience, now envisioned as a Unified Worker/Client Platform. Key requirements include:
1.  **Unified Homepage (Command Center)**: Role-aware with hybrid feed, descriptive buttons (Gigs Near Me, Current Projects, QuickHire) linking to informational pages, and a hidden signup button for logged-in users.
2.  **Unified Opportunity Discovery**: Combines Opportunities and Gigs Near Me into a single interface with 🚨 URGENT and 📅 FLEXIBLE badges, quick apply, and tabs (Emergency, Projects, Hybrid).
3.  **Smart Posting Flow**: Uber-like choice upfront for Regular Project or Emergency / QuickHire with distinct descriptions (e.g., To-Go mode).
4.  **Role-Switching Dashboard**: Adapts based on user intent (Worker Mode navigation: Home, Find Work, Quick Hire, Messages, Profile - with Hire Me & My Projects switch). Includes Available Now toggle.
5.  **Voice-Only Mode**: LLM-powered voice/text input with smart suggestions, auto-translation, 10 languages.
6.  **Enterprise-Grade Settings Module**: 9 backend/frontend sub-sections (My Info, Billing, Security, Teams, Membership, Notifications, Tax Info, Connected Services, Appeals).
7.  **Authentication/Profile**: Sign-up, login, dual onboarding (Professional or General Worker).
8.  **Key Integration Points**: Show emergency gigs alongside regular projects, smart matching, and comprehensive notifications.

**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Central router. The  route was added. Will be updated for the new unified navigation.
-   : Initially created, then fully replaced with a futuristic dashboard design based on user input, and subsequently entirely replaced with the latest unified HTML/CSS design. Includes removal of a temporary green banner. This file previously contained all 9 Epic Platform Innovations UI.
-   : The previous general dashboard page. It was overwritten to adopt the futuristic dashboard design, then again with the latest unified HTML/CSS design. Removed a temporary green banner.
-   : Redesigned for professional projects. Modified to include null-checking for properties (e.g., , ) to prevent frontend crashes, and database connection issues resolved in backend. Its content will be superseded by the new unified feed.
-   : Redesigned for emergency gigs. Modified to include null-checking for properties (e.g., , ) to prevent frontend crashes, and database connection issues resolved in backend. Its content will be superseded by the new unified feed.
-   : Updated to include custom CSS animations for the futuristic dashboard design.
-   : Main backend entry point, acts as the central database connection point.
-   : Main backend entry, updated to include , , , , and  routers.
-   : Provides API endpoints for job posting and fetching. Fixed to correctly import and use the global  client from  and prevent API timeouts.
-   : Created for backend logic of worker-specific features. The  endpoint was fixed.
-   : Created for AI smart matching. The  and  endpoints were fixed by implementing Pydantic models for request bodies.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement the new unified platform vision provided in HTML/CSS (Chat Message 224) into the React app.
-   Redesign the Homepage to be role-aware with Gigs Near Me, Current Projects, and QuickHire buttons.
-   Ensure these new homepage buttons link to informational pages with beautiful designs and pictures.
-   Hide the Sign Up tab for logged-in users on the homepage.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully fixed several critical backend and frontend issues, including:
1.  **Backend API Fixes**: Resolved issues in  for the  endpoint and in  for  and  endpoints by introducing Pydantic models for request validation.
2.  **Database Connection Fix**: Addressed a critical issue where backend API calls (e.g., ) were timing out due to an incorrect database client setup in . This was fixed by correctly importing and utilizing the shared  object from  and restarting MongoDB alongside the backend.
3.  **Frontend Rendering Fixes**: Corrected frontend crashes on  and  by adding null checks for potentially missing data properties (e.g., , ).
4.  **UI Redirection Resolution**: Identified that user was being redirected to profile creation or seeing old UI due to accessing  instead of  and then unified both dashboard pages with the new futuristic dashboard design provided by the user.
5.  **New Platform Vision**: The user has now provided a comprehensive HTML/CSS structure for a completely new, unified Hapployed - Unified Worker/Client Platform (Chat Message 224), which integrates Opportunities and Gigs Near Me into a single feed and introduces a role-switching dashboard. The user explicitly requested to implement all phases at once and provided further specific requirements for the new homepage buttons and hiding the signup button for logged-in users (Chat Message 230). The previous agent acknowledged this.
