The AI engineer's work involved an iterative development process, starting with the implementation of a Role-Based Multi-Hire feature for Professional Projects, necessitating significant backend and frontend model updates. This was followed by a comprehensive overhaul of the application's navigation and authentication flows, guided by detailed user requirements for Find Work, Hire Talent, and Post a Project CTAs, alongside JWT implementation. A critical period involved resolving persistent frontend issues related to API response handling and an undetected backend service outage, requiring deep troubleshooting. Subsequently, the Multi-Hire feature was extended to Local Gig/Task postings. The most extensive recent effort focused on completely reworking and refining the Manage Jobs dashboard and Job Applications pages, incorporating detailed recruiter workflows, improved UI/UX, and real-time metrics, with continuous user feedback driving specific layout and functionality enhancements.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was finalizing significant UX improvements to the Manage Jobs dashboard (). This involved implementing a highly detailed user feedback request to polish the recruiter-facing features.

The work focused on:
1.  **Consolidating Metrics Header**: Replacing scattered metrics with a structured  grid, displaying Active Jobs, Total Applicants, Avg per Job, and Total Views in dedicated, styled  components.
2.  **Enhancing Job Card Layout**: Wrapping each job listing in a visually distinct  container. This includes a  with title and status badge,  (category, location, type, salary),  (post date, view count), and  (View Applicants, Edit, Close) with appropriate buttons and styling.
3.  **Improving Application Status Filters**: Structuring the application status filters as a clear  block with distinct buttons for All Applicants, Saved, Pending, and Accepted.

The  empty state had previously been perfected and required no further changes in this iteration. The current task is in its final stage of applying these visual and structural refinements to . The AI has applied these changes to the frontend file and is in the process of restarting the frontend server to reflect these updates.
