The AI engineer iteratively built Hapployed's frontend, starting with UI improvements and core features like Voice-Only Mode. Key early developments included integrating job posting APIs and initiating Epic Platform Innovations, culminating in a . After initial backend and frontend fixes, the user provided a unified platform redesign, merging Opportunities and Gigs Near Me into a hybrid feed and introducing role-switching. The AI engineer implemented this, beginning with homepage updates.

The first phase focused on a role-aware homepage with descriptive buttons and hiding the Sign Up button for logged-in users. This involved creating  and dedicated informational pages. A subsequent user request led to a complete homepage visual redesign (dark, futuristic theme with metrics and multiple CTAs), which was then integrated, along with restoring original page sections and ensuring all CTAs linked to their respective beautiful informational pages.

Next, the navigation across all dashboard pages (, , ) was updated with a new  featuring a logo, navigation items, and an avatar. This was further refined to incorporate an icon-based design based on a new user-provided screenshot.

A Quick Hire flow was then implemented, creating  and , allowing users to declare availability or find urgent help.

The Find Work functionality was transformed into a unified interface from a detailed HTML/CSS specification, resulting in  and , combining opportunities and gigs with filters and dual application methods.

Finally, the  was refactored into a multi-step form with progress indicators. The most recent task involved enhancing this page to allow adding multiple custom skills and a multiline text input for Other categories. All major features were tested with screenshots for visual verification.

The Hapployed application aims to provide a modern, unified Worker/Client Platform experience. The vision encompasses:
1.  **Unified Homepage (Command Center)**: A role-aware interface with a hybrid feed, prominent buttons like Gigs Near Me, Current Projects, and QuickHire, leading to rich informational pages. The Sign Up option should be hidden for authenticated users. The design evolved to a dark, futuristic theme showcasing key metrics and multiple colorful CTAs.
2.  **Unified Opportunity Discovery**: A consolidated interface for Opportunities and Gigs Near Me, featuring 🚨 URGENT and 📅 FLEXIBLE badges, quick apply options, and categorized tabs (Emergency, Projects, Hybrid). This was realized through the Find Work page.
3.  **Smart Posting Flow**: An Uber-like upfront choice for Regular Project or Emergency / QuickHire with distinct descriptions. This evolved into a multi-step form on the Post a Project page.
4.  **Role-Switching Dashboard**: A dashboard adapting to user roles (Worker Mode: Home, Find Work, Quick Hire, Messages, Profile) with an Available Now toggle. This was reflected in the new  and .
5.  **Voice-Only Mode**: LLM-powered voice/text input with smart suggestions and auto-translation.
6.  **Enterprise-Grade Settings Module**: 9 backend/frontend sub-sections.
7.  **Authentication/Profile**: Sign-up, login, dual onboarding.
8.  **Key Integration Points**: Emergency gigs alongside regular projects, smart matching, and comprehensive notifications.
The recent work significantly advanced the homepage design, unified navigation, Quick Hire, Find Work, and Post Project functionalities.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on enhancing the **Post a Project** page (). This page had been recently redesigned and *overwritten* to feature a new multi-step form with clear progress indicators, addressing a user request for a step-by-step navigation.

The most recent work specifically involved adding advanced input capabilities to this multi-step form:
1.  **Skills Needed**: Implemented the ability for users to add **multiple custom skills**. This allows for a more flexible and comprehensive description of the required expertise for a project. The UI now supports adding as many skills as needed, likely through an input field that adds tags or a similar mechanism.
2.  **Category Selection (Custom Other)**: For the project category selection, a new feature was added where choosing the Other category dynamically reveals an **open multiline text input field**. This allows users to specify a custom category that is not available in the predefined list, accommodating niche or unique project types. This custom input is also carried through to the Review step, ensuring consistency.

These enhancements improve the user experience for project creators, making the posting process more flexible and detailed. The last action was a screenshot verification () which confirmed the custom category input functionality was working correctly on the  page. The application is now capable of capturing more granular project details from users.
