The AI engineer has significantly enhanced the Hapployed application from MVP. Key tasks included completing the Application System, integrating its backend routes and developing frontend components for job application submission and management. Subsequently, the QuickHire/Quick Gigs feature was implemented, involving new backend APIs and dedicated frontend pages for posting, tracking, and worker dashboards, initially with mock services. A major effort was dedicated to resolving multiple deployment blockers by fixing hardcoded database names across various backend files. UI/UX was also refined through a complete redesign of the  for authenticated pages, adding active tab highlighting, and adjusting logout redirection. The engineer also added a My Skills section with validation during job applications and made key navigation texts clickable. Debugging efforts addressed a missing  icon import, investigated non-functional messaging (finding no active conversations), and troubleshot a skills saving error. The current work focuses on implementing a Role-Based Multi-Hire feature for Professional Projects, starting with backend model updates.

<product_requirements>
Hapployed is envisioned as a dynamic, dual-role (Worker/Client) platform for job discovery and posting, leveraging AI for enhanced features and efficiency. The core problem it solves is connecting hirers with workers through a streamlined, intelligent marketplace. Initial requirements focused on a responsive, role-aware homepage, unified opportunity discovery with filtering, and smart job posting incorporating voice input and AI price estimation. The platform needs a role-switching dashboard, comprehensive user profiles, settings, billing, AI-driven features like voice-only mode, verified workforce badges, and smart matching.

Implementation so far includes a re-designed , clickable homepage features, and foundational dual-role onboarding. Backend APIs for Job Posting, Worker Profiles, Messaging, and Application System are functional. A detailed QuickHire/Quick Gigs feature has been implemented, providing an Uber-like flow for urgent tasks, including posting, dispatch, matching, live tracking, and payment processing. The most recent major feature request is a Role-Based Multi-Hire system for Professional Projects, allowing clients to hire multiple professionals for specific roles within a single project, with dynamic form expansion for role details and a Role Tracker Dashboard.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively implementing the **Role-Based Multi-Hire feature** within the existing Professional Project module. This feature aims to enable clients to hire multiple professionals for a single project, explicitly defining roles, required skills, and pay per person/role.

The current task involves **updating the backend  file**. Specifically, the  Pydantic model is being modified to incorporate new fields such as , , and . The  field will be a list containing dictionaries, each defining , , , , , and  options. This foundational backend model change is crucial for handling the structured data of multi-hire projects.

Before initiating this task, the engineer addressed several critical issues:
1.  **Skills Save Error**: Debugged an issue where saving skills was failing. Initial investigation confirmed the backend profile creation was functional, suggesting the problem might stem from frontend authentication or user object handling in . Console logging was added for further diagnosis.
2.  **Messaging Functionality**: Investigated user reports of messaging not working. It was determined that the backend API was correctly returning an empty array due to no existing conversations. The frontend  was improved with better empty states and a Start New Conversation button to enhance user experience.
