The AI engineer, Emergent, was tasked with transforming a basic UI into a modern, eye-catching, futuristic application. The process started with extensive design research, leading to a design system-first approach utilizing Glassmorphism, Cyberpunk aesthetics, Bento grids, and 3D effects. The engineer iteratively built out the application's frontend, focusing heavily on UI/UX, responsiveness, and micro-animations, while adhering to strict color and gradient guidelines.

Key phases included: a complete homepage redesign (Hapployed theme), implementing a robust authentication and profile creation flow with route guards and onboarding, developing a complex Gigs Near Me discovery page with diverse viewing modes and filters, and a Post a Project page offering regular, emergency, and quick-post options. Throughout, the AI responded to user feedback, enhancing color vibrancy, fixing technical issues (e.g.,  package), and integrating features like a custom Other category input and dynamic navigation. The current task involves completing and verifying the dual onboarding path for skilled professionals and general laborers.

4.  **Post a Project / New Gig Flow**: Fast, friendly experience with a toggle between Regular Project and Emergency / QuickHire.
    *   **To-Go Mode**: 30-second condensed post with AI fill-in.
    *   **Regular Project**: Title, rich description, category, amount (AI suggests), visibility, work model, dates, screening questions, milestones, attachments, trust checklist, preview, save draft, autosave.
    *   **Emergency / QuickHire**: Radius, short description, amount (AI surge), time window, equipment/license chips, contact preferences, safety, posting speed emphasis.
    *   **AI Helpers**: Budget, description scoping, tagging, screening questions, fraud checks, suggested shortlist.
    *   **Success Flow**: Confirmation, share, boost, invite talent, messaging integration.
    *   **Mobile & Accessibility**: Sticky post, stepper, large touch targets, voice input.
    *   **Guardrails & Trust**: Payment method, pre-fund hold, client verification.
5.  **Logo Integration**: Use the provided Hapployed logo across all screens.
6.  **Other Input Fields**: Add an Other option to category dropdowns (on Post Project and To-Go forms) and Equipment/License Needed section, which prompts a text box for custom input.
7.  **Navigation Links**: Update the navigation bar to include Post a Project and remove Gigs Near Me from the homepage navigation.
8.  **What We Offer Page**: Create a new page with a detailed description of the app's offerings, including visuals, and integrate a back navigation.
9.  **Dual Onboarding Experience**: Redesign the profile and AI onboarding for both skilled professionals and general laborers, featuring smart auto-detection, visual skill selectors, physical availability sections, location-first discovery, AI auto-labeling, conversational onboarding, badges, lifestyle-driven bio helpers, and local incentives.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of completing and verifying the implementation of the **dual onboarding experience** on the . This involved intelligently adapting the profile creation flow for both skilled professionals and general laborers by auto-detecting keywords, presenting visual skill selectors (e.g., icons), and including sections for physical availability and capabilities. The AI's last action was to state its intention to take screenshots and verify this functionality, indicating that the implementation is coded, but its visual confirmation and testing are still in progress. This feature aims to make Hapployed an inclusive platform, guiding users with different backgrounds through a tailored profile setup.
