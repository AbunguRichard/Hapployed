The AI engineer successfully implemented the Dual Persona Switch and revamped the Recruiter and Talent Dashboards. Initially, the focus was on the persona switch, which involved backend updates for  initialization,  modifications for role switching, creating a dynamic , and updating navigation. This required iterative debugging for frontend component visibility (VerificationPage, Verification.js) and login redirection logic. The engineer then meticulously refined the top navigation's QuickHire dropdown and struggled through multiple iterations to implement a specific glowing button style on the homepage, eventually settling on a simpler blue design before the user provided a clearer screenshot, leading to the correct implementation.

Following this, the engineer embarked on a major visual and functional overhaul of the Recruiter and Talent Dashboards. This involved converting provided HTML/CSS into React components, integrating comprehensive sidebar navigation, and dynamically displaying user roles. Significant effort was spent debugging sidebar visibility, primarily due to routing conflicts and layout issues, which were resolved by correctly linking routes to the modified dashboard components and adjusting CSS. Finally, the engineer began creating production-ready pages for all sidebar items (, , , , , , , ), successfully implementing the first few with detailed UIs, and resolving a  icon dependency issue. The current work halted mid-implementation of the last set of sidebar pages.
