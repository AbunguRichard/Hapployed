The previous AI engineer's work spanned several major feature developments and significant refactoring. Initially, efforts focused on implementing a Role-Based Multi-Hire feature for various project types, followed by a comprehensive overhaul of authentication and navigation, migrating to JWTs. A period of intensive debugging addressed critical frontend issues related to API response handling. Subsequently, the Manage Jobs dashboard and Job Applications pages were completely rewritten to improve recruiter workflows and UI/UX. More recently, the focus shifted to implementing a dual-track navigation system to separate Gig Work from Professional Work, which involved multiple iterations due to user feedback on visual design and routing. The engineer also redesigned the empty states for My Gigs and My Projects pages. The current state is debugging a navigation issue where clicking My Gigs or My Projects leads to the generic Worker Dashboard.

Hapployed is a dual-role (Worker/Client) platform using AI for job discovery and posting, aiming to connect hirers and workers. The initial implementation includes a responsive homepage, unified opportunity discovery, AI-powered job posting, role-switching dashboard, and user profiles, with a  and functional backend APIs. Key features requested and implemented/under development:
1.  **Role-Based Multi-Hire**: Enable clients to hire multiple professionals for a single project, defining roles, skills, and pay, extended to Local Gig/Task postings.
2.  **Comprehensive Navigation & Auth Flows**: Implement seamless routing and authentication, including Find Work, Hire Talent, Post a Project CTAs, reusable , role-based guards, JWT authentication, and user/profile data models.
3.  **Improved Manage Jobs Dashboard**: Rework  into a comprehensive recruiter dashboard with consolidated job cards, status filtering, key performance metrics, bulk actions, advanced filtering, sorting, and responsive design. This involved fixing data consistency and UI polish.
4.  **Improved Job Applications Page**: Enhance applicant view to handle empty states, display applicant profiles with status and application dates, and ensure seamless navigation from Manage Jobs.
5.  **Dual-Track Navigation**: Introduce a clear separation between Gig Work and Professional Work in the navigation, affecting dropdowns (Gig Work, Professional Work, My Engagements), routing (e.g.,  vs ), dashboard views ( vs ), and the Find Workers page (with Gig Workers and Professional Talent tabs).
6.  **Redesign Empty States**: Create engaging and actionable empty states for My Gigs and My Projects pages, including educational content, quick actions, popular categories, and success stories.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had completed the redesign of the My Projects empty state, providing a comprehensive HTML/CSS solution converted into a React component with Tailwind CSS. This followed a similar successful redesign of the My Gigs empty state. The overall goal was to enhance the user experience for both gig workers and professional project seekers by providing engaging, actionable, and informative empty states for their respective dashboards, accessed via the My Jobs dropdown. However, the user reported that clicking My Gigs or My Projects from the navigation bar was still leading to the outdated Worker Dashboard page, indicating a routing or component rendering issue that needs to be resolved. The AI engineer has just acknowledged this and is about to investigate the navigation routing to fix the problem.
