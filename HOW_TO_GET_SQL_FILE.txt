HOW TO GET THE SQL FILE TO YOUR EMAIL
===========================================

Since I cannot send emails, here are 3 easy ways to get the file:

METHOD 1: Use the QUICK START file (Recommended for now)
---------------------------------------------------------
The file "QUICK_START_ESSENTIAL.sql" in /app/supabase/ has all the core tables.
It's smaller and easier to copy. This will get your app working!

Location: /app/supabase/QUICK_START_ESSENTIAL.sql

Copy and paste this into Supabase SQL Editor.


METHOD 2: Download from this environment
---------------------------------------------------------
If you have access to download files from this development environment:

Full File: /app/supabase/MASTER_SETUP_ALL_IN_ONE.sql (46KB)

Or use the 3 parts:
- /app/supabase/PART_1_OF_3.sql
- /app/supabase/PART_2_OF_3.sql  
- /app/supabase/PART_3_OF_3.sql


METHOD 3: Copy in 3 Parts from Chat
---------------------------------------------------------
I can show you Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 separately.
You copy each part into Supabase and run them one by one.


METHOD 4: Create Download Link
---------------------------------------------------------
If this app has a public URL, I can help you access the file through a web browser.


RECOMMENDED: Start with QUICK_START_ESSENTIAL.sql
===========================================
This file has all the important tables:
✅ Users & Worker Profiles
✅ Jobs & Applications
✅ Wallets & Transactions  
✅ Messages
✅ Security (RLS) policies

This is enough to get your Hapployed app working!

You can add more tables later if needed.
